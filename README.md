# 🌟 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model for QA Bot 💡

---

🎯 **Problem Statement:**
Develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model for a **Question Answering (QA) bot** for a business.

💼 **Objective:**  
Use a vector database like **Pinecone DB** and a generative model like **Cohere API** (or any other alternative). The QA bot should retrieve relevant information from a dataset and generate coherent, context-aware answers.

---

### 🚀 **Task Requirements:**

1. ✅ Implement a **RAG-based model** that can handle questions related to a provided document or dataset.
2. ✅ Use a **vector database** (e.g., Pinecone) to store and retrieve document embeddings efficiently.
3. ✅ Test the model with various queries to show how it retrieves and generates **accurate answers** from the document.

---

### 📦 **Deliverables:**

1. 📑 A Colab notebook demonstrating the full pipeline: from **data loading** to **question answering**.
2. 📘 Documentation on the **model architecture**, retrieval approach, and how generative responses are created.
3. 📊 Several example queries with **corresponding outputs**.

# ⚙️ Part 1: Setting Up the Environment

---

### 1️⃣ **Installing Required Libraries** 📥

To get started, install the following libraries:

- `pinecone-client` for managing vector storage and retrieval.
- `cohere` for embedding generation and text generation via Cohere API.
- `transformers` for tokenization and leveraging pre-trained NLP models.

```bash
!pip install pinecone-client cohere transformers
```

---

### 2️⃣ **Importing Libraries** 📚

Next, import the necessary libraries and initialize Pinecone and Cohere clients:

```python
from pinecone import Pinecone
import cohere
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
import torch

# Initialize Pinecone
pc = Pinecone(api_key="YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY")
index = pc.Index("index384")

# Initialize Cohere
cohere_api_key = "YOUR_COHERE_API_KEY"
co = cohere.Client(cohere_api_key)
```

---

# ✏️ Part 2: Tokenization and Embedding Generation

---

### 3️⃣ **Loading Tokenizer and Model:**

Use the **'all-MiniLM-L6-v2'** model for creating text embeddings:

```python
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

def embed_text(text):
    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt', padding=True, truncation=True)
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    embeddings = outputs.last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1)
    return embeddings.detach().numpy()[0]
```

---

# 📄 Part 3: Document Embedding and Storage

---

### 4️⃣ **Loading Documents and Storing Embeddings:**

We now embed the documents and store them in the Pinecone index:

```python
documents = [
    "Document 1 on AI and ML...",
    "Document 2 on supervised learning...",
    # More documents...
]

# Embed and store documents in Pinecone
for i, doc in enumerate(documents):
    vector = embed_text(doc)
    index.upsert(vectors=[(str(i), vector)])
```

---

# 🔍 Part 4: Document Retrieval

---

### 5️⃣ **Retrieving Relevant Documents** 🧐

Define a function to retrieve the most relevant documents based on a query:

```python
def retrieve_documents(query, top_k=3):
    query_embedding = embed_text(query)
    results = index.query(vector=query_embedding.tolist(), top_k=top_k)
    relevant_docs = [documents[int(match['id'])] for match in results['matches']]
    return relevant_docs
```

---

# 🤖 Part 5: Generating Answers

---

### 6️⃣ **Generating Responses** 📝

Once the relevant documents are retrieved, generate an answer using Cohere's API:

```python
def generate_answer(relevant_docs, query):
    context = " ".join(relevant_docs)
    response = co.generate(
        model='command-xlarge-nightly',
        prompt=f"Answer the question based on the context: {context}\n\nQuestion: {query}",
        max_tokens=100,
        temperature=0.7
    )
    return response.generations[0].text
```

---

# 🎯 Part 6: Running the Pipeline

---

### 7️⃣ **Putting It All Together** 💻

Now, let's run the complete pipeline for a sample query:

```python
query = "What is Machine Learning?"
retrieved_docs = retrieve_documents(query)
answer = generate_answer(retrieved_docs, query)

print("Query:", query)
print("Retrieved Docs:", retrieved_docs)
print("Generated Answer:", answer)
```

---

# 📊 Example Queries and Answers:

- **Q**: What is Machine Learning?  
  **A**: Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of AI focused on developing algorithms that allow computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions...

- **Q**: What are key areas of AI?  
  **A**: Key areas of AI include Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, and Robotics...

# 🌐 Conclusion

---

This **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** model combines the power of **vector-based search** with **coherent response generation**, providing efficient and accurate question answering from large datasets.
